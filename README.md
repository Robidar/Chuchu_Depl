## Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk prediction 

The codes utilised for model development are available on this GitHub repository. Additionally, the repository contains the saved model in .pkl format, along with the app.py and requirements.txt files. The figure below shows the survival probabilities of four patients as an example, at 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year intervals.
The survival probability was generated using our best-performing model (DeepSurv) via "streamlit run app.py" in the terminal to open the web application locally.

To open the streamlit web app (app.py) and check the survival probability locally, visit https://streamlit.io/cloud and https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/a-beginners-guide-to-learning-to-code-with-github-codespaces/
